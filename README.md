You can read his comments below: 
I was traveling by air for almost a day from my hometown in Scotland. I had to make a stop at [bold]Gatwick Airport[bold] in London. I was traveling on a business trip. I am a lawyer at a very renowned and prominent firm in Aberdeen, Scotland. I was working by profession and worked for a big lawsuit that was assigned to me by the firm. I had to be at another law firm in [bold]Dover[bold] called Frederic Hall Solicitors. 
But first, I decided that I would take a little break for dinner as It was getting close to midnight and I was feeling hungry because I was flying for hours and never liked airline food. But before that, I thought I’d make a booking for a cab and then go and have a nice big meal. I looked on the internet and found a few cab services available around the area. I found [company] with good user reviews on it. I called the cab and the driver was on time, greeted me in a gentlemanly manner and was well educated. He offered to take my luggage and then placed it in the trunk of the cab. I already told him that we would stop for a bit at the nearest restaurant for dinner. He agreed and after dinner went on with our journey. I booked a Cab from [bold]Gatwick Airport to Frederic Hall Solicitors, Dover [bold]. 
Our first stop was at Scott’s Steakhouse @The Old Bell. It was my first time eating there, but I found good reviews about them on the internet. I ordered a full steak with liqueur as I was very hungry. While I was eating my dinner the driver was patiently waiting for me in the car, although I had invited him to join me for dinner, he kindly declined the offer by saying that he had already eaten his dinner. It was just after midnight and I was already getting tired and needed some rest to stay fresh the next day at the meeting with the firm in the [bold]Dover[bold]. After nearly a drive of two hours, we were finally at Frederic's. I was welcomed there by a colleague whom I have only met once before while working on a case in London. 
But It was my first time in [bold]Dover[bold]. They had arranged for me a lodge next to the main office. The cabby handed me over my suitcases and then politely said his goodbyes. I was to spend the night there, the next day I was collecting some important documents from the firm and attending a meeting there on behalf of my firm. This whole day was filled with tiresome and interesting stories.

I was traveling to [bold]Durham University[bold] to meet my brother, who is in his final year. Because of the COVID restrictions and lockdowns, I had not been able to meet my brother for a long time. In fact, for the last two years, we had not seen each other in person. I was dying to meet my brother and hug him, I am sure that he feels the same for me. Since our childhood, we were both inseparable. He is a year older than me. I am currently studying at a university in Edinburgh. I have four semesters remaining in my degree. I am studying Zoology at The University of Edinburgh. My brother is doing his Master’s in Botany at [bold]Durham University[bold]. We both love nature and plants. We grew up on a country farm with cattle and livestock. So that’s why nature is a big part of our life. 
We are originally from the highlands, Inverness. At a very early age, I decided that I would do my doctorate in science, especially on animals. We had three cows on our farm and a dozen chickens. We also had goats, sheep, rabbits, and geese. We also had 2 horses which I named after the Greek war leaders. One is called Leonidas and the other is Hercules. My personal favorite was Leonidas and I used to ride him on our farm and in the mountains. I planned a trip from my university, I was traveling late at night in order to reach there early in the morning. My brother, Desmond, did not know anything about my arrival there at the university. My exams were getting near and I had managed to take only a couple of days off from [bold]The Edinburgh University[bold]. But most of my time was going to be either on the road or in the air. But I wanted to spend as much time as possible with my brother. After reaching the airport I looked for a cab service on the internet. 
I booked a cab from [company] because they had good reviews on the internet. The cab driver reached within the expected time of arrival and I did not have to wait for long, the cab driver appeared to be very efficient and educated. He greeted me with manners and asked for my bags to be placed in the trunk of the car. I booked a cab from[bold]Gatwick Airport to Durham University[bold]. I was getting excited by every passing moment and could not wait to meet my brother. Along the way, I had a really good talk with the cabby. We had a very light-hearted conversation and in the end, we both knew at least something about each other. After nearly a drive of four and a half hrs. We reached the university. I said my farewell to the cab driver and started walking toward the university. I then reached his room and he opened the door and got shocked. Wed me to his room. With a surprised look and a smile, he said, “what are you doing here, Mark”. Getting acquainted with each other, after a couple of years, he then invited me into his room.

We received a story from one of our clients as a thank your letter for the service which we got from our Company. We are proud to publish these nice words and very happy to add one happier customer to our growing family. 
You can read his comments below; 
I’ve just moved from Pakistan and got transferred to [Bold]Bicester[Bold] University which is one of the largest universities in Wales. I arrived at [Bold]Heathrow airport[Bold] to meet my aunt there. She was very old to pick me up from the airport, so I did not bother her. However, she did mention [Comapny] in order to book a cab in future. She was a satisfied customer so I did not hesitate to look for alternatives. I called [Company] and told them to accompany me to one of their best cabs as soon as possible. Within 15 minutes, a cab was waiting outside for me. I met the cab driver and he was a very nice person. I’ve had a great experience with him along the way. The driver waited for me till I reached the airport terminal. He was carrying a name board with my name written on it. 
He offered me free meet and greet services He was courteous and a well-mannered person. He saw me with heavy bags so, he took them from me and put them in the trunk. He offered me a bottle of water on the journey. His response was adaptive when I asked him to get me to the nearest coffee shop. He was smart and took me to one of the best coffee places in the city. The driver showed an impressive set of driving skills. I did not feel any bumps on the road. He even checked on me a couple of times to make sure that I’m comfortable. I decided not to stop at any other place and asked my cab driver not to stop at any other place. He replied ok. After covering around 40 minutes of drive, I reached my aunt’s house. 
The journey was delightful. I was really satisfied with [Company], that didn’t hesitate me to ride with them again. This time I was heading towards [Bold]Bicester[Bold] University. I was worried that I might reach the university late and would be late for the open day, that’s what I thought but turns out, it was the opposite. It seems that the driver was well aware of the city’s routes. He used smart routes which saved a lot of time for me. That is what I call professionalism. The cabs I use for daily travel back in my country are very bad and unhygienic which makes a negative impact on the customer, this was exceptional in the case for [Company]. The cab I used was clean and eco-friendly. It was well maintained and didn't cause any kind of noise or problems along the way. [Company] lives up to my expectations and will consider it in future.

I booked a [company] cab online and took my father with me. The [company] cab driver was already present at the airport. He was holding a signboard on which my name was written. [company] cab driver opened the door for us. We sat in the cab and our journey started from [bold]Southend Airport to Worcester[bold].

Worcester is a cathedral city and the ceremonial county town of Worcestershire, England. A 102,791-person population was anticipated in 2019.

Royal Worcester Porcelain, Edward Elgar, Lea & Perrins, a company that produces authentic Worcestershire sauce, the University of Worcester, and Berrow's Worcester Journal, which claims to be the oldest newspaper in the world, are all located in Worcester. The English Civil War came to an end in 1651 with Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army defeating King Charles II's Royalists at the Battle of Worcester. We saw Worcester Cathedral from Fort Royal Hill. Then we moved towards the entrance of the cathedral. The [company] cab driver stopped at the parking place and we moved to the inner worship place. We offer prayers there which are about our Christian customs. We captured some pictures in the cathedral. Later, we moved toward the medieval cloisters. 
We had some extra time, so we moved to some famous places. Use diabetes, the first Norman sheriff of Worcestershire, oversaw the building of a new castle at Worcester, albeit nothing of the fortress is still standing today. By 1069, Worcester Castle was complete, with its outer bailey constructed over what had been the Worcester cathedral chapter monks' cemetery. Just south of the cathedral, the castle's motte had a view of the river. After that, we moved towards the Tudor buildings on Friar Street. It was awesome. I asked my father to visit Worcester Guildhall. He agreed to it and we reached there by using the [company] cab which we had hired for the whole journey. We saw the statue of Edward Elgar. It was evening, so we moved back to our original home. The [company] cab driver behaved nicely throughout the journey. It was the first visit of my life to Worcester which became possible because of my father’s assistance.

What Is NFT and Why Are People Crazy About It?
Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that people use to transact goods and services. As the number of cryptocurrencies is increasing daily, it is becoming difficult to differentiate between them and understand how cryptocurrency works. 
A type of cryptocurrency called NFT (Non-Fungible Token) was developed for non-fungible tokens. NFT is a cryptocurrency for digital collectibles that runs on the block chain. They serve as a metaphor for things that are unique and unreplaceable. 
For example, if you buy a statue from a company, it will be shipped to your address, but it is impossible to purchase multiple figures simultaneously. So, it is a great idea to use NFT for such a purpose. 
How does it work?
The concept of NFT is based on the idea that the digital assets created for the users are non transferable. These digital assets are unique and can’t be transferred to another person. The NFT will also have a certain amount of supply, and the collection will be fixed. 
The quantity of tokens that can be produced has no upper bound. The only limit is the amount of supply that is available. The collection can be increased or decreased according to the demand. 
Why is NFT in high demand? 
NFT is in high demand because of its unique features of it. Using NFT to market a high-quality product will be a great idea. This will distinguish your product from others and help you advertise your company. 
Why are people crazy about it? 
As per my knowledge, NFT is the best form of investment. There is a strong possibility of the price of NFT increasing daily because they are less expensive than the other cryptocurrencies. 
Compared to traditional assets, NFTs can potentially increase the demand in the market. As people invest in NFTs, the market may become more attractive, and the price of NFTs will increase.
The NFTs can be traded and transferred similarly to other cryptocurrencies. Investing in NFTs, selling them, and sharing the money in the same way as you invest in traditional assets is possible.
